Length-extension attack on SHA1
===============================

vuln.rb implementes an example web application which uses SHA1(secret + message)
as message authentication which is vulnerable to a length-extesion attack. Also,
the message is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs with a stupid parser
which allows you to overwrite previous keys by specifying values for them again,
therefore introducing a security vulnerability when you are able to append
stuff to the input (and generate valid tokens).

* Run vuln.rb
* Go to http://localhost:3000/
* Get guest token
* Base64.urlsafe_decode64(user) to see what's in there

* Run ./sha1 <keylen> <decoded user data> <auth token> ",admin=true"
* Encode new message in base64 again
* Request page
* Repeat with keylen++ if authentication failed
